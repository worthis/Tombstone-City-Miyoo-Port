    "abandoned city somewhere in the ",
    "Southwestern United States. The ",

    "ending, meaning the only way the",
    "game will end is when all",
    "schooners are gone.",
    "",
    "@Gameplay",
    "@--------",
    "The player's schooner starts out",
    "in the middle of sixteen blocks.",
    "These are used as shelter as the",
    "Morgs cannot enter this area. ",
    "The player must venture out to",
    "shoot either tumbleweeds",

    "only cacti standing individually",
    "so that no more Morgs can appear",
    "",
    "@Strategy",
    "@--------",
    "The Morgs can only appear from a",
    "cactus that is immediately next ",
    "to another cactus, and whenever ",
    "a Morg is shot and killed, it ",
    "turns into another cactus. One ",
    "useful strategy is to try to ",
    "shoot a Morg against two cacti,",
    "because all three cacti will dis",
    "appear and become another Morg ",
    "that, if shot immediately, will ",
    "turn into a stand-alone cactus.",

    "left hand corner of the screen.)",
    "A new day starts with the cacti ",

    "receives a bonus schooner.",
    "",

    "",
    "The sixteen blocks in the center",
    "of the screen are used as base ",
    "and shelter for the schooner.",
    "Any time a schooner is killed by",
    "a Morg, the new schooner starts ",
    "in the middle. If a Morg is",
    "killed right next to one of the ",
    "exits, a cactus is placed there ",
    "and the exit is blocked off for ",
    "the day. When all exits are ",
    "blocked off, the schooner is",
    "automatically moved to somewhere",
    "outside. If the schooner is",
    "killed at this point, the new",
    "schooner appears somewhere else ",
